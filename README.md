# OAK_startup_progress
This repo is a Tech Assignment for OAK'S LAB.

The assignment:
Every startup goes through several stages. In every stage, there are necessary steps
to be accomplished.
Create a simple application that documents this progress.

Requirements:
- Every phase can have an unlimited amount of tasks.
- If the startup accomplishes all tasks in the phase, itâ€™s marked as done and
unlocks the next phase.
- Tasks cannot be marked as completed unless all tasks in the previous phase
were completed.

Requirements - Frontend:
- Implement in React.
- Store the progress in local storage.
- When all phases are completed, display a random fact from
