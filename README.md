# OAK_startup_progress
This repo is a Tech Assignment for OAK'S LAB.

<h2>The assignment:</h2>
Every startup goes through several stages. In every stage, there are necessary steps
to be accomplished.
Create a simple application that documents this progress.


<h2>Requirements:</h2>
- Every phase can have an unlimited amount of tasks.
- If the startup accomplishes all tasks in the phase, itâ€™s marked as done and
unlocks the next phase.
- Tasks cannot be marked as completed unless all tasks in the previous phase
were completed.

<h2>Requirements - Frontend:</h2>
- Implement in React.
- Store the progress in local storage.
- When all phases are completed, display a random fact from
https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/random.json .


<h2>HOW TO USE</h2>
Just fork this repo, clone it in your local directory, and inside it run:
<pre><code>cd startup_progress
npm install
npm start
</code></pre>
